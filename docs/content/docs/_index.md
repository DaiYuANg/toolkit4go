# ArcGo

**ArcGo** is a modular Go backend infrastructure toolkit. It consists of independent packages, so you can adopt only what you need.

## Quick Start

```bash
go get github.com/DaiYuANg/arcgo/{package}
```

## Package Overview

| Package | Purpose | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [authx](./authx) | Authentication & Authorization | Extensible abstraction for multi-scenario authentication and authorization |
| [clientx](./clientx) | Protocol Clients | Protocol-oriented clients (`http/tcp/udp`) with shared engineering conventions |
| [collectionx](./collectionx) | Data Structures | Generic collections and concurrency-safe structures |
| [configx](./configx) | Configuration Management | Hierarchical configuration loading and validation |
| [dix](./dix) | Application Framework | Strongly typed modular app framework built on `do` |
| [eventx](./eventx) | Event Bus | In-process strongly typed event bus |
| [httpx](./httpx) | HTTP Routing | Multi-framework unified strongly typed HTTP routing |
| [kvx](./kvx) | Redis / Valkey Access | Strongly typed Redis / Valkey object access and repository layer |
| [logx](./logx) | Logging | Structured logging with slog interoperability |
| [observabilityx](./observabilityx) | Observability | Optional observability abstraction (OTel/Prometheus) |
| [dbx](./dbx) | ORM & Migrations | Schema-first / generic-first ORM core on `database/sql` |
| [sqltmplx](./sqltmplx) | SQL templates | SQL-first conditional templates (`dbx/sqltmplx`); use with or without full `dbx` |

## Documentation layout

- Use the top navigation or the table above to open each package section.
- Documentation section standard: [Package Documentation Standard](./standards)
- Runnable examples live under repository `examples/` and are only supporting sample code.
- Chinese prose for several packages is on `*_index.zh.md` pages where provided.

## How to Choose

- Need container/data utilities: Start with `collectionx`
- Need an extensible authentication/authorization abstraction: Start with `authx`
- Need protocol-oriented clients (`http/tcp/udp`) with shared conventions: Start with `clientx`
- Need configuration loading from `.env` + files + environment variables: Start with `configx`
- Need modular application composition, typed DI, lifecycle, and startup validation: Start with `dix`
- Need in-process typed pub/sub: Start with `eventx`
- Need unified typed HTTP handlers across frameworks: Start with `httpx`
- Need strongly typed Redis / Valkey repositories and access helpers: Start with `kvx`
- Need SQL-first dynamic query templating with optional parser-backed validation: Start with `dbx`（includes `dbx/sqltmplx`）
- Need structured logging with rotation: Start with `logx`
- Need optional telemetry abstraction (OTel/Prometheus): Start with `observabilityx`

## Typical Combinations

- **API Service Baseline**: `httpx + configx + logx`
- **Modular App Baseline**: `dix + configx + logx`
- **Event-driven within monolith**: `eventx + logx`
- **Redis / Valkey-backed service**: `kvx + httpx + configx`
- **Data-intensive tools/internal libraries**: `collectionx + configx`

## Common Commands

```bash
# Format code
go tool task fmt

# Lint code
go tool task lint

# Run tests
go tool task test

# Full check
go tool task check
```

## Pre-commit Git Hook

The repository uses `lefthook` (managed via `go tool`).

Install once per clone:

```bash
go tool task git:hooks:install
```

Run hooks manually:

```bash
go tool task git:hooks:run
```

The `pre-commit` hook runs:

- `go tool task fmt`
- `go tool task lint`

## Notes

- Code comments are unified in English
- Chinese documentation uses `_index.md` files
