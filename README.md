# arcgo

`arcgo` is a modular Go toolkit for backend infrastructure.
It is package-oriented, supports incremental adoption, and allows inter-package composition.

## How To Choose Quickly

- You need container/data helpers: start with `collectionx`.
- You need opinionated auth/authz abstraction on Authboss + Casbin: start with `authx`.
- You need config from `.env` + file + env vars: start with `configx`.
- You need an ORM with schema modeling, query DSL, and migrations: start with `dbx` (it also provides pure SQL templates via `dbx/sqltmplx`).
- You need a strongly typed modular application framework: start with `dix`.
- You need process-local pub/sub with typed payloads: start with `eventx`.
- You need protocol-oriented clients with shared retry/TLS/hooks conventions: start with `clientx`.
- You need unified typed HTTP handlers across frameworks: start with `httpx`.
- You need Redis/Valkey typed object mapping + repository-style access: start with `kvx`.
- You need structured logs and rotation: start with `logx`.
- You need optional telemetry abstraction (OTel/Prometheus): start with `observabilityx`.

## Typical Stack Combinations

- API service baseline: `httpx + configx + logx`
- Modular app baseline: `dix + configx + logx`
- Domain-events in a monolith: `eventx + logx`
- Data-heavy utility/internal libs: `collectionx + configx`
- Data layer (ORM + pure SQL helpers): `dbx` (includes `dbx/sqltmplx`)
- Redis/Valkey data access: `kvx + configx + logx`

## Build & QA

```bash
go tool task fmt
go tool task lint
go tool task test
go tool task check
```

## Docs Utility (Cross-Platform)

```bash
go run ./scripts/deploy-docs help
go run ./scripts/deploy-docs sync
go run ./scripts/deploy-docs build
go run ./scripts/deploy-docs serve
go run ./scripts/deploy-docs deploy
# optional:
# DOCS_REMOTE=origin DOCS_BRANCH=gh-pages go run ./scripts/deploy-docs deploy
```

## clientx Examples

```bash
go run ./examples/clientx/edge_http
go run ./examples/clientx/internal_rpc_tcp
go run ./examples/clientx/low_latency_udp
```

## Git Pre-Commit Hook

This repo uses `lefthook` (managed via `go tool`).

Install hooks (run once per clone):

```bash
go tool task git:hooks:install
```

Run hooks manually:

```bash
go tool task git:hooks:run
```

The `pre-commit` hook runs:

- `go tool task fmt`
- `go tool task lint`

## Notes

- Code comments are English-only.
- All documentation is available at the Hugo documentation site.
- Release policy: Before the Go "generic method" proposal is released/adopted, this library will not be formally published. After the proposal lands, expect potentially wide breaking updates. At this stage, we do not recommend using it in production.
